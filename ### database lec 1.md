 5. DBase
 6. Foxbase
 7. Foxpro

	*relational database management system*

 3. **dbms works on file system rdbms works in tabular form**
 4. **dbms takes more time rdbms takes less time**
 5. **In dbms the relation between two files maintain programmatically  but where in rdbms the relation forms during creating a table**
